Data Viewer for the Yuan-Tseh Lee Arry Correlator

The Yuan-Tseh Lee Array is a cosmology/astropysics mm-wave interferometer array built and operated by ASIAA and NTU. The array is located in the Mauna Loa Observatory on Big Island, Hawaii. The first project on YTLA is the Array for Microwave Background Anisotropy (AMiBA, 2006-2014). The second project is the ASIAA Intensity Mapping with Carbon Monoxide (AIM-CO, constructing). 

This data viewer is intended for the 1k channel digital correlator of the AIM-CO project. (created May/2017)
